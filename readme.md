Customer Churn Prediction
Welcome to the Customer Churn Prediction project! This repository contains a machine learning solution designed to predict whether a customer is likely to leave (churn) a service or subscription.

ðŸ“Œ Overview
Customer churn prediction is a vital task for businesses to identify customers at risk of leaving. Using historical data and machine learning techniques, we can classify whether a customer is likely to churn and take proactive measures to retain them.

ðŸ’» Features
Data preprocessing pipeline for handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns in customer behavior.
Multiple classification models:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
Hyperparameter tuning with techniques like GridSearchCV or Optuna.
Model evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and other metrics.
Deployment-ready script with model inference code.
