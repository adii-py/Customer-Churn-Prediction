# Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

## Overview

Customer churn prediction is crucial for businesses to retain customers by identifying those who are likely to leave. This project leverages an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer churn based on historical data.

## Problem Statement

Businesses often lose customers due to various reasons, and predicting churn can help in taking proactive retention measures. Using ANN, we aim to classify customers as likely to churn or not based on their behavioral patterns and demographics.

## Dataset

Source: Publicly available customer churn dataset (e.g., Telecom, Banking, Subscription-based services)

## Features:

Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Tenure, etc.)

Account details (Subscription type, Monthly charges, Contract type, etc.)

Service usage (Internet service, Streaming services, etc.)

Target variable: Churn (Yes/No)

## Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

## Neural Network Architecture:

Input Layer: Based on the number of features

Hidden Layers: Fully connected dense layers with ReLU activation

Output Layer: Single neuron with Sigmoid activation (Binary classification)
